# SARM Protocol

**Stablecoin Automated Risk Management Protocol**

A Uniswap v4 Hook that makes stablecoin liquidity "risk-aware" using institutional-grade ratings.

## Overview

SARM Protocol integrates S&P Global Stablecoin Stability Assessment (SSA) ratings into Uniswap v4 pools to:
- Adjust pool fees dynamically based on stablecoin risk
- Enforce risk modes and circuit breakers when ratings degrade
- Provide LPs with protection against depeg events

## Built For

- **ETHGlobal Buenos Aires 2025**
- **Uniswap v4 Stable-Asset Hooks Track**
- **Chainlink Bounty** (S&P Global SSA feeds)
- **The Graph Bounty** (Risk analytics & dashboards)

## Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **SSAOracleAdapter** (`src/oracles/SSAOracleAdapter.sol`)
   - Single source of truth for stablecoin ratings on-chain
   - Caches S&P Global SSA ratings (currently manual, Chainlink integration coming)
   - Emits `RatingUpdated` events for indexing

2. **SARMHook** (`src/hooks/SARMHook.sol`)
   - Uniswap v4 Hook implementing risk-aware swap logic
   - Reads ratings from SSAOracleAdapter
   - Applies dynamic fees and circuit breakers based on risk
   - Emits `RiskCheck` events for analytics

3. **MockERC20** (`src/mocks/MockERC20.sol`)
   - Test stablecoin tokens for development

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Hook + Manual Ratings ✅
- [x] SSAOracleAdapter with manual rating setter
- [x] SARMHook with beforeSwap logic
- [x] Circuit breaker for high-risk ratings (FROZEN mode)
- [x] Risk mode transitions (NORMAL → ELEVATED_RISK → FROZEN)
- [x] Comprehensive Forge tests

### Phase 2: Dynamic Fees ✅
- [x] Fee tier calculation based on ratings
- [x] Dynamic fee application in beforeSwap with override flag
- [x] Event emission for analytics (FeeOverrideApplied)
- [x] Tests for fee progression with risk levels

**Dynamic Risk-Adjusted Fees:**

SARM Protocol implements dynamic LP fees that adjust automatically based on the credit risk of the stablecoins in a pool. This ensures LPs are compensated appropriately for the risk they bear, while maintaining competitive fees for high-quality stablecoins.

**Fee Structure:**

| Credit Rating | Risk Level | LP Fee | Basis Points | Use Case |
|--------------|------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1-2 | NORMAL | 500 | 0.05% (5 bps) | High-quality stablecoins (USDC, USDT) |
| 3 | ELEVATED_RISK | 1000 | 0.10% (10 bps) | Stablecoins showing stress signals |
| 4-5 | FROZEN | 3000* | 0.30% (30 bps) | Depeg risk/Circuit breaker active |

*Note: Rating 4+ typically triggers the circuit breaker, blocking swaps entirely. The 0.30% fee would only apply if special exceptions are implemented.

**How It Works:**

1. **Before every swap**, the hook queries both token ratings from the oracle
2. The **effective rating** is calculated as `max(rating0, rating1)` (worst-case)
3. The hook maps the effective rating to the appropriate fee using `_feeForRating()`
4. The fee is returned with `LPFeeLibrary.OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` to apply for that specific swap
5. A `FeeOverrideApplied` event is emitted for analytics and indexing

**Benefits:**

- **Risk Compensation**: LPs earn higher fees when holding riskier assets
- **Market Signals**: Fee changes provide real-time risk signals to traders
- **Capital Efficiency**: Low fees on safe pairs maximize trading volume
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Seamlessly works with risk gating system

### Phase 3: Chainlink Integration (TODO)
- [ ] Chainlink SSA feed interface
- [ ] refreshRating() implementation with real feeds
- [ ] Mock Chainlink feed for tests
- [ ] Automated rating updates

### Phase 4: Analytics + Frontend (TODO)
- [ ] The Graph subgraph for event indexing
- [ ] RiskCheck and FeeOverrideApplied event tracking
- [ ] Risk dashboard UI showing ratings and fee history
- [ ] LP analytics (fees earned by risk level)

## Risk Rating Scale

S&P Global SSA ratings map to SARM risk modes:

| Rating | S&P Assessment | SARM Mode | Action |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **1** | Excellent stability | NORMAL | 0.05% fee |
| **2** | Good stability | NORMAL | 0.05% fee |
| **3** | Moderate stability | ELEVATED_RISK | 0.10% fee |
| **4** | High depeg risk | FROZEN | Swaps blocked |
| **5** | Critical/Imminent depeg | FROZEN | Swaps blocked |

**Risk Modes:**

- **NORMAL**: Ratings 1-2, normal operation with competitive fees
- **ELEVATED_RISK**: Rating 3, higher fees to compensate for increased risk
- **FROZEN**: Ratings 4-5, circuit breaker activated, all swaps blocked

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Circuit Breaker Protection
Automatically blocks swaps when stablecoin ratings indicate high depeg risk, protecting LPs from toxic flow.

### 💰 Dynamic Risk-Adjusted Fees
LP fees adjust in real-time based on S&P Global credit ratings, ensuring proper risk compensation.

### 📊 Full Transparency
All risk assessments and fee changes emit events for on-chain analytics and The Graph indexing.

### 🔗 Institutional Data
Integrates S&P Global SSA ratings via Chainlink feeds (Phase 3), bringing institutional-grade risk assessment to DeFi.
